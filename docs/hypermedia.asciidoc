## Preliminaries

### Low-level Encoding (LLE)

The low-level data encoding consists of arbitrary-sized signed
integers, UTF-8 strings, and lists.

Example low-level data using JSON syntax:

* -1243

* "hello"

* ["foo", ["bar", 12]]

All application and protocol data units are ultimately encoded in LLE.

#### Order

The order among data of different types is number < string < list.

The usual rule that shorter lists sort before longer lists with the
same prefix applies.

### High-level Encoding (HLE)

A high-level encoding with support for features such as records and
decimal numbers is layered on top of the low-level encoding.

#### Lists

Because the high-level encoding uses a format similar to Lisp function
calls for records, plain lists themselves have to be wrapped in a
"call" to "list".

This creates the list [1, 2, 3] in the high-level encoding:

* ["list", 1, 3, 4]

#### Records

Records are expressed as a type name a set of fields.

This creates a record of type person with two fields, age and name.

* ["person", ["age", 35], ["name", "Manuel"]]

The fields are always sorted by name.

#### Decimals

Arbitrary sized decimal numbers are represented as records with an
exponent and a mantissa, with some special encoding rules to allow
natural sorting by the low-level ordering rules.
