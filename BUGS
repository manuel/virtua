* Line comments and the whitespace of a file parse as #inert.
  This means that the programs "12 ;; foo" and "12 " evaluate
  to #inert, clearly evil.

* DEFINE-CLASS creates new class, even if class exists.
  It should redefine the class, bring it up to date, instead.

* Integration of JS's undefined is logically flawed.
  It's impossible to assign undefined to a variable, because
  environment lookup will confuse it with a non-existing binding.
